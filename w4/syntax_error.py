# I picked SyntaxError. Because I got them alot when I started to learn to code. I still get them but I try to take my time and make sure my syntax is correct.
def errorFunction(myError) #the fix to add :
    if myError != 'is this an error?':
    print('yup, there is a syntax error') #and indent this line


isError = errorFunction('no error')
print(isError)
